Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; And haste is needful in this desperate case. Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf Go levy men, and make prepare for war; They are already, or quickly will be landed: Myself in person will straight follow you. But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague, Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest. Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance: If it be so, then both depart to him; Tell me if you love Warwick more than me? I rather wish you foes than hollow friends: But if you mind to hold your true obedience, Give me assurance with some friendly vow, That I may never have you in suspect.
