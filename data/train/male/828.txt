France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears, If Talbot but survive thy treachery. Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress, Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares, That hardly we escaped the pride of France. An alarum: excursions.   BEDFORD, brought in sick in a chair.  Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:
within LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD, ALENCON, and REIG-
NIER, on the walls.
