Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's steward-- get on thy boots: we'll ride all night. O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph! Pistol,  utter more to me; and withal devise something  to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!
