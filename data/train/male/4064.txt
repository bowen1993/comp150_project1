So please your majesty, I would I could Quit all offences with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal: Yet such extenuation let me beg, As, in reproof of many tales devised, By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers, Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear, I may, for some things true, wherein my youth Hath faulty wander'd and irregular, Find pardon on my true submission.
