There's little can be said in't; 'tis against the rule of nature.   To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature.

Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by 't: out with't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
