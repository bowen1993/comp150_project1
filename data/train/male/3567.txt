We have beat him to his camp: run one before, And let the queen know of our gests. Tomorrow, Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood That has to-day escaped. I thank you all; For doughty-handed are you, and have fought Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors. Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends, Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss The honor'd gashes whole. Give me thy hand; Enter CLEOPATRA, attended.  To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts, Make her thanks bless thee. To Cleo. O thou day o' the world, Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all, Through proof of harness to my heart, and there Ride on the pants triumphing!
