Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged, Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be 't yours, Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe, Csar's no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd; Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen; For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep: Our care and pity is so much upon you, That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
