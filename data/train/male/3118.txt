Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honor, I lose myself: better I were not yours Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested, Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady, I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste; So your desires are yours.
