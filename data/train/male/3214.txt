I was as virtuously  given as a gentleman need to be; virtuous  enough; swore little; diced not above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarterof an hour; paid money that I borrowed, three or four times; lived well and in good compass: and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.
