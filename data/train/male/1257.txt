Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead. I see a strange confession in thine eye: Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so; The tongue offends not that reports his death: And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, Not he which says the dead is not alive. Ye the first bringer of unwelcome news, Hath but a losing office, and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell, Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
