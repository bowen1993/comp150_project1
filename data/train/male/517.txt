Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus: That, in regard King Henry gives consent, Of mere compassion and of lenity, To ease your country of distressful war, And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace, You shall became true liegemen to his crown: And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear To pay him tribute, and submit thyself. Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him, And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
