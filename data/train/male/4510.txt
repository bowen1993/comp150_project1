Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord!   Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would of-- I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
