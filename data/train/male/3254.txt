She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down And rest your gentle head upon her lap, And she will sing the song that pleaseth you And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep, Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness, Making the difference 'twixt wake and sleep As is the difference betwixt day and night The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team Beg'ns his golden progress in the east.
