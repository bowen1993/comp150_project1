Ho, ho, ho! Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus! Grace grow where those drops fall ! My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense; For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts, I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than death and honor. Let's to supper, come, And drown consideration.
