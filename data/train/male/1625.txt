O Antony ! I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine; we could not stall together In the whole world: but yet let me lament, With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, That thou, my brother, my competitor In top of all design, my mate in empire, Friend and companion in the front of war, The arm of mine own body, and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle,that our stars, Unreconciliable, should divide Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends, But I will tell you at some meeter season: The business of this man looks out of him; We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you ?
