Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow? Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son? What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian, And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles? O, where is faith?   O, where is loyalty? If it be banish'd from the frosty head, Where shall it find a harbour in the earth? Wilt thou go dig a grave to find our war, And shame thine honourable age with blood? Why art thou old, and want'st experience? Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it? For shame in duty bend thy knee to me That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
