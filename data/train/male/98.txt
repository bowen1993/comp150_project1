I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst.   You are straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that backing of your friends?   A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day.
