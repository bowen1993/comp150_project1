O, wert thou for myself!   But, Suffolk, stay; Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth; There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk. Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise: Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount, And natural graces that extinguish art; Repeat their semblance often on the seas, That when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet, Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
