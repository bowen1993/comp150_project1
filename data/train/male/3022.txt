Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, And we must sleep. Does pay thy labor richly; go. Exit Mardian.  Off, pluck off: The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides ! Heart, once be stronger than thy continent, Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace. No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go; You have been nobly borne. From me awhile. Exit Eros.  I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now All length is torture: since the torch is out, Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labor Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done. Eros !I come, my queen:Eros !Stay for me: Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze: Dido and her neas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros! Re-enter EROS.
