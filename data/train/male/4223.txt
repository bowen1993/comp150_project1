Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks, Because this is in traffic of a king. And yet, methinks, I could be well content To be mine own attorney in this case. I'll over then to England with this news, And make this marriage to be solemnized. So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe In golden palaces, as it becomes.
