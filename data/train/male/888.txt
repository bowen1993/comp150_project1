Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone: This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York; And   this the hand that slew   thy brother Rutland; And here's the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself; And so, have at thee! Warwick comes;  Clifford flies.
