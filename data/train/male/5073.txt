This is the strangest fellow, brother John. Come bring your luggage nobly on your back: For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have. The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours. Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field, To see what friends are living, who are dead. [Exeunt Prince of Wales and Lancaster.
