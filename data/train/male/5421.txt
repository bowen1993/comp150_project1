Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens So in the earth, to this day not known: Late did he shine upon the English side; Now we are victors; and upon us he smiles. What towns of any moment but we have? At pleasure here we lie near Orleans; Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts, Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
