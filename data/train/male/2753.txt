I am accursed to rob in that thief's company:   the rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know not where.   If I travel but four foot by the squier further afoot, I shall break my wind.   Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I 'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company  hourly any time this two and twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me medicines.   Poins!   Hal!   a plague upon you both! Bardolph!   Peto!   I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further.   An 'twere not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me; and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:   a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another! Whew! A plague upon you all!   Give me my horse, you rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
