One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song: would God would serve the world so all the year; we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson.  One in ten, quoth a'!   An we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck one.
