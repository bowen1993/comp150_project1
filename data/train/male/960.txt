Get thee gone: Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, He hath spoken true : the very dice obey him; And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance : if we draw lots, he speeds; His cocks do win the battle still of mine, When it is all to nought; and his quails ever Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt: And though I make this marriage for my peace, I' the east my pleasure lies. Enter VENTIDIUS.  O, come, Ventidius, You must to Parthia: your commission's ready; Follow me, and receive't.
