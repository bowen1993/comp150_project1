Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd; Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest, Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate: But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed; And now is York in arms to second him. I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him, And ask him what's the reason of these arms. Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower; And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither, Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
