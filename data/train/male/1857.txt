You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what. The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman: Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled ? But if your father had been victor there, He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry: For all the country in a general voice Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king. But this is mere digression from my purpose. Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace That he will give you audience; and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just, You shall enjoy them, every thing set off That might so much as think you enemies.
