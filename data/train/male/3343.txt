Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden, but a monument: As you are now, for you are cold and stern; When you are dead, you should be such a one And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got.
