What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent, And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you; Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths? Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon, Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty ' Who hateth him and honours not his father, Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake, Shake his weapon at us and pass by.
