That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman!   His industry is up-stairs and down-stairs; his eloquence the parcel of reckoning.  I am   not yet of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou killed   to-day?' 'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some fourteen,'  an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.'   I prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer  his wife.   'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
