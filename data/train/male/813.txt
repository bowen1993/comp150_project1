The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world, The noblest; and do now not basely die Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman,a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going; I can no more.
