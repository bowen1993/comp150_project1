Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Csar's triumph. Let him take thee. And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians: Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let Patient Octavia plough thy visage up With her prepared nails. 'Tis well thou'rt gone, If it be well to live; but better 'twere Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death Might have prevented many. Eros, ho ! The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me, Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon; Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage: And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club, Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die: To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho! Exit.
