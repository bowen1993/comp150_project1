Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence, But never tax'd for speech.  What heaven more will, That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head!  Farewell, my lord; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, Advise him.
