O Charmian, Where think'st thou he is now ? Stands he, or sits he ? Or does he walk ? or is he on his horse ? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony ! Do bravely, horse ! for wot'st thou whom thou movest ? The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile ?' For so he calls me: now I feed myself With most delicious poison. Think on me, That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, And wrinkled deep in time ? Broad-fronted Csar, When thou wast here above the ground, I was A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow; There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life.
