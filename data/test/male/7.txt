The devil it is that's thy master.  Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of thy sleeves? do other servants so?   Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands.   By mine honor, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee: I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
