To me, blood-thirsty lord; And for that cause I train'd thee to my house. Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me, For in my gallery thy picture hangs: But now the substance shall endure the like, And I will chain these legs and arms of thine, Thou hast by tyranny these many years Wasted our country, slain our citizens And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
