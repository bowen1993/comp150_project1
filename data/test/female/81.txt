Question, my lords, no further of the case, How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place But weakly guarded, where the breach was made. And now there rests no other shift than this; To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed, And lay new platforms to endamage them.  They fly, leaving
   their clothes behind.
