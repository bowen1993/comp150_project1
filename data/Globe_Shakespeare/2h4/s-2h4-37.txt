Here, sir.
A woman's tailor, sir.
I will do my good will, sir: you can have no more.
I would Wart might have gone, sir.
It shall suffice, sir.
By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind: an't be my destiny, so; an't benot, so: no man is too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
