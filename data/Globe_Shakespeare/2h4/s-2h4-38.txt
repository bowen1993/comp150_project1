Yea, an 't please you.
I was pricked well enough before, an you could have let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry  and her drudgery: you need not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter to go out than I.
Spent!
And, good master corporal captain, for my old dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old, and cannot help her -self: you shall have forty, sir.
