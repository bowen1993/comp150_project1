The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.
At Basingstoke, my lord.
No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse, Are march'd up to my lord of Lancaster, Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
I must wait upon my lord here; I thank you, good Sir John.
