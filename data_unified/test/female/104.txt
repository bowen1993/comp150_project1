The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly. Now help, ye charming spells and periapts; And ye choice spirits that admonish me And give me signs of future accidents. You speedy helpers, that are substitutes Under the lordly monarch of the north, Appear and aid me in this enterprise. Enter Fiends.  This speedy and quick appearance argues proof Of your accustom'd diligence to me. Now ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd Out of the powerful regions under earth, Help me this once, that France may get the field. They walk, and speak not.  O, hold me not with silence over-long! Where I was wont to feed you with my blood, I'll lop a member off and give it you In earnest of a further benefit, So you do condescend to help me now. They hang their heads.  No hope to have redress?   My body shall Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit. They shake their heads.  Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice Entreat you to your wonted furtherance? Then take my soul, my body, soul and all, Before that England give the French the foil. They depart.  See, they forsake me!   Now the time is come That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest And let her head fall into England's lap. My ancient incantations are too weak, And hell too strong for me to buckle with: Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust. Exit.  Excursions. Re-enter LA PUCELLE fighting
   hand to hand with YORK: LA PUCELLE is
   taken. The French fly.
