Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's remembrance, be at accord.
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master! he would not have spoke such a word.
Dear master, I can go no further: O, I die for food! Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
