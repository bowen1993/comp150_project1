My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.
I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord protector.
Mine is, an't please your grace, against John Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.
