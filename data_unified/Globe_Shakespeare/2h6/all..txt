Come, let's be gone.
God save your majesty!
He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain and a traitor.
Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
It shall be done.
O, brave!
God save the king! God save the king!
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.
God save the king! God save the king!
