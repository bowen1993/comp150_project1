These letters come from your father.
He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth; And at the time of my departure thence He was much fear'd by his physicians.
My lord, here are letters for you.
My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.
