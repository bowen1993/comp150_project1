Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valor and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humor your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.", "Come, shall we hear this music?", "Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.", "Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.", "Do so: farewell. Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?", "How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.", "Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?", "It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.", "An he should, it were an alms to hang him.

Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?", "Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.", "Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.", "I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon.", "Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.", "Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad, he wants money.", "Draw it.", "What! sigh for the toothache?", "There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as, a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet.

What thinkest thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.", "Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?", "As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?", "By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.", "I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,' said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise:' 'Certain,' said she,'a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.'

He hath every month a new sworn brother.", "Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.", "No; an he were, I would burn my study.

Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.", "A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
