Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged, And how the English have the suburbs won.
But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me: Chief master-gunner am I of this town; Something I must do to procure me grace, The prince's espials have informed me How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, Wont through a secret grate of iron bars In yonder tower to overpeer the city And thence discover how with most advantage They may vex us with shot or with assault. To separate this inconvenience, A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed; If I could see them. And even these three days have I watch'd, Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer. If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word; And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
