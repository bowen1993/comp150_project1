No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart Will not confess he owes the malady That doth my life besiege.   Farewell, young lords; Whether I live or die, be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,-- Those bated that inherit but the fall Of the last monarchy,--see that you come Not to woo honour, but to wed it: when The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek, That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
