My desolation does begin to make A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Csar; Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave, A minister of her will: and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds; Which   shackles   accidents   and   bolts   up change; Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, The beggar's nurse and Csar's.
