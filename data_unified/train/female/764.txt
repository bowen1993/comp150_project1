Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord! Our strength is all gone into heaviness, That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power, The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up, And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little, Wishes were ever fools,O, come, come, come; And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived; Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out.
