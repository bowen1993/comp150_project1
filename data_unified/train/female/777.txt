Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir ; If idle talk will once be necessary, I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin, Do Csar what he can. Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court; Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me ! rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies Blow me into abhorring! rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet, And hang me up in chains!
