What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly: Now is it manhood, wisdom   and defence, To give the enemy way, and to secure us By what we can, which can no more but fly. If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom Of all our fortunes: but if we haply 'scape, As well we may, if not through your neglect, We shall to London get, where you are loved And where this breach now in our fortunes made May readily be stopp'd. Re-enter young CLIFFORD.
