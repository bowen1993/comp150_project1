Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master Tisick, the debuty t'other day; and, as he said to me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last. 'I' good faith, neighbor Quickly,' says he; Master Dunbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbor Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil; for' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a' said so, I can tell whereupon: 'for,' says he, 'you are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none here: you would bless you to hear what he said: no, I'll no swaggerers.
