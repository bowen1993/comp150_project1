Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently. Follow I must; I cannot go before, While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind. Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood, I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks And smooth my way upon their headless necks; And, being a woman, I will not be slack To play my part in Fortune's pageant. Where are you there?   Sir John! nay, fear not, man, We are alone; here's none but thee and I. Enter HUME.
